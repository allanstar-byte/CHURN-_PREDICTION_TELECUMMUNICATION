# CHURN-_PREDICTION_TELECOMMUNICATION

The main concern here is to build models to predict churn. The predictive model that that will serve two purposes:

i. It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

ii. It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks. In some cases, both of the above-stated goals can be achieved by a single machine learning model. But here, you have a large number of attributes, and thus you should try using a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA and then build a predictive model. After PCA, you can use any classification model.
